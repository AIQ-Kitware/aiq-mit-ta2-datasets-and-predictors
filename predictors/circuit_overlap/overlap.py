"""Circuit overlap metrics.

Ported from arithmetic-inconsistencies/attribution/scripts/run_overlap.py.

Given a reference circuit (aggregate attribution vector over reference items)
and a per-item attribution vector, computes three overlap scores:

  sum_on_S       -- sum of item's attributions at the reference's top-K positions
  cosine_with_S  -- cosine similarity between item vector and reference vector
  jaccard_with_S -- Jaccard overlap between item's top-K and reference's top-K

'sum_on_S' was the strongest predictor in the original work (rpb ≈ 0.38).

# The question those statements pose is this file's question: is a circuit a
# property of the FUNCTION the network computes, or of its PARAMETERIZATION?
# Hidden units carry a permutation symmetry -- relabel them, permute the
# adjacent weights, and the network computes exactly the same function -- and
# every per-unit attribution moves with that relabelling.
#
# Within one model that is harmless, and saying so is worth as much as flagging
# the cross-model case: the reference circuit is built from the same model's
# own correct examples, so a relabelling moves both sides together. That is the
# deployed use and it is sound.
#
# All three statements are `sorry`, so they are linked with `motivates`: this
# code is evidence the statements are asked to explain, not a test of them.
# Every predicate is a no-op at run time; MAGNET reads them with `ast`.
