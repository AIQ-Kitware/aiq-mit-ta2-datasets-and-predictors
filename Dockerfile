# MIT CircuitOverlap: the image the card's one node runs in.
#
# The card's kwdagger DAG has a single node, circuit_overlap, whose command is
# `bash magnet_adapter/run_predictor_env.sh`. That node runs as one
# `docker run` of this image, with this checkout bind-mounted at its own
# absolute path and the working directory set there. The copy baked below
# provides the environment; the mounted checkout provides the code, so editing
# the predictor or the card does not mean rebuilding.
#
# Build, from the repository root:
#   docker build -t mit-circuit-overlap-gpu .
#
# MAGNET_REF is the aiq-magnet commit the evaluator runs against. It is
# on AIQ-Kitware/aiq-magnet main (the kwdagger execution merge, PR #94);
# `--build-arg MAGNET_REF=main` builds against the tip of main instead.
#
# Never baked: the HELM benchmark_output the predictor reads, and the
# Qwen3-4B weights (HuggingFace cache). Both are mounted at run time. See
# docs/containerized_evaluation.md.
